Supersede CSS JLG (Enhanced) is a visual toolkit for building CSS effects in WordPress. It bundles live editors, preset generators, and token management to speed up styling without touching code.

## Installation

1. Ensure your site runs **WordPress 5.8 or later** and **PHP 8.0+**. No additional dependencies are required.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. From the `supersede-css-jlg-enhanced` directory, run `npm install` to install the front-end dependencies.
4. Upload the `supersede-css-jlg-enhanced` folder to `wp-content/plugins/`.
5. In the WordPress admin, navigate to **Plugins → Supersede CSS JLG (Enhanced)** and click **Activate**.

## Modules

- **Générateur d’Effets Visuels** – Create CRT scanlines, animated backgrounds and ECG style overlays.
- **Tron Grid Animator** – Generate retro‑futuristic animated grid backgrounds with adjustable colors, thickness and speed.
- **Avatar Glow** – Design glowing avatar frames with gradient presets and comet‑like trails.
- **Token Manager** – Define reusable CSS tokens (variables) and inject them into your site’s styles.
- **Animation Studio & Grid Editor** – Visual tools for building keyframe animations and CSS grid layouts from presets.

## Usage

1. After activation, open **Supersede CSS** in the WordPress dashboard.
2. Choose a module tab to enable it and tweak settings in real time.
3. CSS generated by each module is automatically stored and applied to the front‑end.
4. Use the **Token Manager** to add or edit CSS tokens; reference tokens within your custom styles.
5. Export or import presets as needed from the built‑in tools.

## Hooks

### `ssc_required_capability`

Filter the capability required to access the Supersede CSS admin pages and REST API endpoints. By default the plugin uses
`manage_options`, but site administrators can delegate access with a simple filter:

```php
add_filter('ssc_required_capability', function () {
    return 'edit_theme_options';
});
```
